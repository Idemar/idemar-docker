# My self hosted server

Im running a old DELL laptop Core i5 as a self hosted homelab.

OS: Proxmox Virtual Environment (Type 1 hypervisor). [Proxmox home page]([https://](https://proxmox.com/en/))

And on Proxmox i run multiply VM (virtual machine) OS. Where i also run docker container on one of the VM.

I use this homelab to test systems like CRM, helpdesk, warehouse system, Home assist, IoT, and so on..
This server let me test systems on many OS and enviroments to make sure all works fine before the system move to production version.
