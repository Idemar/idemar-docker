# My self hosted server

Im running a old DELL laptop Core i5 as a self hosted homelab.

OS: Proxmox Virtual Environment (Type 1 hypervisor). [Proxmox home page]([https://](https://proxmox.com/en/))

And on Proxmox i run multiply VM (virtual machine) OS. Where i also run docker container on one of the VM.

I use this homelab to test systems like CRM, helpdesk, warehouse system, Home assist, IoT, MySQL/Postgres/SQL, and so on..
This server let me test systems on many OS and enviroments to make sure all works fine before the system move to production version.
